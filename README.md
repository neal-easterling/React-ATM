# React-ATM

## Description

React ATM assignment from MIT xPro Fullstack Dev with MERN class.  Assignment is to adapt starter code to data validate to prevent overdraft, as well as improve UI by creating a dropdown for transaction type.

## Changes

I significantly altered the stylings.  Also created a transaction ledger using React component that tracks and displays transactions during this session.  No database connection, so all tracking is lost between sessions.
